	    	<h1>Making things from wood</h1>
    		<div>
                <p>My dad gave me my first hammer when I was probably 8 or 9 years old.  He pointed to the scrap bin and a coffee can of nails and said something like “You can use any wood in of that pile and the nails in this can.”  My dad has been a carpenter his whole life, really since he was a kid.  I pounded most of the nails from that coffee can into those wood scraps all summer.  Eventually you develop an understanding with a hammer, any tool really, and learn how to use it effectively.  Everyone should take some time to hammer some nails.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="woodgrid">    
                <h2 class="compost">Compost bin</h2>
                <img class= "compostbin mdblueborder float_l" src="images/compost_bin.jpeg" alt="compost bin"/>
                <div class="compostp"><p>Our yard has a lot of big trees around it and we get a lot of leaves in the fall.  Partly to minimize the amount of compostable material that needs to be hauled away and partly out of curiosity, I built a 4ft x 8ft compost bin last summer.  <br> The frame is made out of 2in x 3in lumber with 1in. x 2in. lumber for the slats.  I mulled over the plans for several weeks, but when I finally committed, I was able to get the materials and build over a weekend.</p></div>
                
                <h2 class="workbench">Work bench</h2>
                <img class="bench mdorngborder float_r" src="images/small_workbench.jpeg" alt="small work bench"/>
                <div class="benchp"><p>This is the first and smallest of three work benches I am planning for my garage.  It is patterned after a similar bench I remember my dad using when I was a kid. <br>  Even though I am planning to build some larger (and more practical) benches, this bench will continue to be a useful piece of shop furniture.  It is easy to move around and provides a clampable workspace without taking up too much room.  The blue stain used is the same as the dice tray described later on this page.</p></div>
            
                <h2 class="ladder_plank">Ladder plank</h2>
                <img class="ladderplank ltblueborder float_l" src="images/ladder_plank.jpeg" alt="ladder plank"/>
                <div class="ladderp"><p>This plank was put together with an old scrap of plywood and some new 2in. x 4in. lumber for the frame.  Like the blue work bench, it is also patterned after a plank I remember my dad using when I was a kit.  <br> I built this plank to be able to paint the walls over an open stairwell.  Since then I have used it to help me paint the outside of my house.  Most of the time it lives in the garage under the car.</p></div>
               
                <h2 class="dicetrays">Dice trays</h2>
                <div class="dicetray1p"><p>I had a vision for a dice rolling tray that had two tiers, one for holding dice and one for rolling them.  I also wanted a blue and orange tray, but I just couldn't find one so I made one. <br>The sides are 1in. x 3in. with a 1/4in. plywood bottom. The liner is crafting felt and the stain is a water-based, with a wax finish. It's a little big and kind of heavy, but it was a fun project.</p></div>
                
                
                <img class="dicetray1 ltorngborder" src="images/dice_tray_blue.jpeg" alt="orange and blue wooden dice tray"/>
                <img class="float_r dicetray2 mdblueborder" src="images/dice_tray_brown.jpeg" alt="brown and green wooden dice tray"/>

                <div class="dicetray2p"><p>Since then I made some smaller, lighter weight trays.  Mostly made with thinner pieces of trim molding, still finished with  water-based stain and furniture wax.  The green felt liner in this tray started pilling pretty quickly.  Future versions will need a hardier felt, maybe something for a pool table.</p></div>
