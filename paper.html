                <p>The first origami pattern I remember making was a sonobe cube in 6th grade.  With practice I soon learned how to put together a dodecahedron (12 faces) icosahedron (20 faces) with sonobe pieces.  The pieces themselves are relatively easy to make, and do not take a up a lot of room until fully assembled.  I would often work on them during class or on longer car rides, leaving behind a trail of these paper balls.</p></div>

                <div class="origami_p2"><p>Once I learned how to find books about origami in the library, it was over.  I was hooked.  Once people in my life found out about this hobby, I started to get packs of beautiful origami paper for gifts.  “Origami paper” us cut square and is usually thinner than regular printer paper.  I like using it, certainly, but I also like to fold animals and flowers out of found paper, catalogs, junk mail, posters, magazines, wrappers.</p></div>
                
                

                <h2 class="cards_and_books">Cards and books</h2>
                <img class="cards_books float_r mdorngborder" src="images/notebook.jpeg" alt="small paper notebook"/>
                <div class="cards_books_p"><p>Some years ago, I worked at a place called Paper Source, a store that sells cards and gifts, but also paper crafting supplies.  There I learned how to make my own cards and stationery, paper decorations, even simple books.  Just like with origami, I enjoy using fine papers to make things but also really enjoy using found materials like left over wrapping paper, old calendars and magazines, or any kind of cardboard box.</p></div>
