    		<article>
                <p>Thank you for visiting!  This site shares some of the many things I like to make.  Each page is centered around a major material type: wood, fibers, and paper.  Each page shares some general thoughts and then some details on specific projects. </p>
                
                <h1 class="mdorngbckgrnd">Current Projects</h1>
                
                <p>Here is what I am working on right now.  Some projects are completed shortly after they begin, but others are worked on for a while then set aside. These usually tend to be big projects or projects where I am still working my way through fundamentals.</p>

                <div class="current_projects">
                <h2 class="playingcard">Playing Card cross stitch</h2>
                <img class="pcard ltblueborder float_r" src="images/hoyle_shellback_card.jpg" alt="hoyle shellback cards"/>
                <p class="pcardp1">This is Hoyle's Shellback Playing Card in blue and red. The plan is to translate this image to a piece of counted cross-stitching.  Iâ€™ve been working on this for over 10 years.</p> 
                
                    
                <p class="pcardp2">First, I printed a large version of the image, then began tracing it onto graph paper.  The next step is to rasterize the image as it appears.  From there I work on cleaning up the lines and standardizing the pattern, correcting the variations in design that come from enlarging such a small image to such a large size.</p>
                <img class="pcardpattern ltblueborder float_l" src="images/shellback_pattern.jpeg" alt="cross-stitching pattern"/>
                <p class="pcardp3">Here I am testing a section of the current pattern and color choice.  Even with a 1:1 scale pattern, it can be difficult to see what finished stitching will look like. <br>This is an ambitious project and I often have to set it aside and take a break to work on other smaller projects.  <br></p>

                

                <h2 class="knittedsocks">Knitted Socks</h2>
                <img class="ksocks ltblueborder float_r" src="images/knit_socks.jpeg" alt="knitted socks"/>
                <p class="ksocksp">A few times a year I get out some knitting needles and knit some socks or a hat or a scarf.  I am currently working on a small series of socks and trying to make adjustments to the pattern to achieve a different fit.  These types of projects require careful attention to a pattern, but the stitches are simple and can be done while watching TV.</p>
